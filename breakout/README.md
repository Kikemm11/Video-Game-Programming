## Dust Shield Powerup 


Dust shield powerup when taken has the ability to create a masive wall of dust at the bottom of the screen,
this avoids the ball or balls to keep falling in the depths of the screen and make the player to loose a life.
It appears after hitting a brick with 7.5% chances just like the CannonFire powerup and has a kind of 
orange/yellow color.
But be careful, this powerup only last 15 seconds active and doesn't warn you when it's about to end, so don't 
be naive and keep moving your paddle
On the other hand try to combine it with the TwoMoreBall powerup it will be fun and could lead you to win levels 
faster than you can imagine.
